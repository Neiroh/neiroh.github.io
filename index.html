            <p>All the pages have been coded and designed by me. you will be able to check more details about every
                project in the <b><i>"view more"</i></b> button of any project</p>
            <p>I've used native JS, HTML and native CSS to design this frontend</p>

                        informations and news about animes you are interested in.</p>

                    <p>It took me 2 months and a half to develop, once I finished it I felt really prideful because it's
                        a big project and it could be bigger</p>

                    <p>One day, I was talking to a friend that was studying in the university and he was looking for a
                        way to develop a website because he was interested in having one for his <b><i>end of
                                career</i></b> project. He was studying the career <i>Business Administration and
                            Management</i> and once he told me, I offered as a developer for his page</p>
                    <p>We were meeting for one week to talk about that, and at least we could elaborate together a big
                        idea. The professor was the user that navigates, and she was really surprised abour our work. At
                        least we decided not to publish that because
                        we are developing and upgrade for the page to use the definitive version in his <b><i>master
                                degree</i></b></p>

                    <p>At the end of the superior degree, our teacher told us to make a project with some colleagues,
                        and after thinking for a looooooong time, we decided to make an art gallery in which users could
                        comment, like and look for some artistic
                        pictures.
                    </p>
                    <p>My principal role in this teamwork was fullstack, I was the one who created some PHP code, native
                        JS and checked and fix some CSS problems. It was my first project, and the first time I worked
                        as a team at coding</p>
