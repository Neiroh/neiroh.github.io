                    <p>Hi, I'm Raúl Fernández Arce. I was born the 13th july 2001 in Ceuta, Spain. I'm a web application
                        developer, but it wasn't my first idea as a child.</p>

                    <p>I like to learn about new things, the more, the better, and when I was 7 years old, I wanted to
                        be a perfumer and a chemical. That was my idea for 8 years, also I studied french in my
                        Secondary school because after finishing the career
                        I was going to study a perfumist master degree.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content">

                    <img src="../images/me/graduacion2.jpg" alt="My end of grade celebration">
                </div>

                <div class="infoText">
                    <p>Despite ot that, in my bachelor studies, I decided to study science because I wanted to start a
                        TI career instead of chemistry one.</p>

                    <p>Although I was thinking that that idea was the best for my vocation, when I was at the second of
                        three days doing the final exams, a friend told me about a superior degree about coding,
                        something I started to love in my 2<sub>nd</sub> grade of the bachelor studies, where my teacher
                        taught me about coding in C and C++</p>

                    <p>Then, I decided to start the superior grade, something that was really criticised for my family.
                        At least, I kept strong at that idea and that year, in september 2019, the <b><i>Web Application
                                Development Superior Degree</i></b> started.</p>

                    <p>My 1<sub>st</sub> year there was a little bit difficult because of the <i>Covid-19</i>, and in
                        2020-2021 course, I started again and decided to get the best grade and so, I started to study
                        really hard. At least I got my objective.</p>

                    <p>My 2<sub>nd</sub> grade (2021-2022) was about a lot of design, PHP and JS projects (that last
                        module was like "learn by yourselves" because our teacher had no idea about coding with JS, or
                        maybe he only didn't know how to teach us).
                        I loved that and I kept with the best grades.</p>

                    <p>At march we started the <b><i>End of Grade</i></b> project until June, meanwhile, we started to
                        practise in a comany (my practices were at <b>Tecnalis</b>). My practices started the 7
                        <sup>th</sup> march, and I finished the 8<sub>th</sub> june, when the <i>Human resources</i>
                        department told me to start working with a contract.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays I'm still working there as a Fullstack Developer at the <b>Delivery department</b>
                        installing and configuring casino games in those websites. I also fix some clients issues when a
                        game doesn't work, the money don't flow as
                        it should or those kind of casino things.</p>
